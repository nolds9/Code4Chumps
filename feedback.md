# Project 2 Evaluation

Please review [inline code comments]https://github.com/nyron/Code4Chumps/compare/master...nolds9:feedback) prefixed my initials `NHO`

## Technical Requirements

> 0 Models, or partial CRUD on at least 1 model.

Would love to see you come back to this and implement the rest of CRUD for `users` and add your second associated model.

## Creativity and Interface

> The app is styled and has an interface of value to the end user: it is not just a nav bar and an index page

Good practice using bootstrap.

## Code Quality

> Code lacks proper formatting, includes commented out, non-functional code, or otherwise contains major issues of quality (DRY, naming, etc)

## Deployment and Functionality

> Application contains no major errors, is deployed correctly, and contains a custom Heroku app name appropriate for the app.

Great work deploying!

## Planning / Process / Submission

> App is submitted, with basic evidence of planning. Documentation exists, but lacks common areas such as setup instructions, description of application functionality and link to deployed application

Would be great to include more descriptions in your `README` about the application
